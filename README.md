For this homework assignment, we were asked to create a three-page portfolio website that was responsive at different screen widths. The lesson was meant to get us familiar with Bootstrap and its grid system. The requirements for this assignment were:
  <ul>
    <li>Three pages: index, portfolio, and contact, with personalized info and social media links.</li>
    <li>Utilization of Bootstrap's grid system.</li>
    <li>A navbar that is consistent on each page.</li>
    <li>Functioning links.</li>
    <li>Semantic and validated HTML.</li>
    <li>A responsive layout with responsive images.</li>
    <li>Website deployed to GitHub with a ReadMe, live with no errors.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
<p>While I understood how to do most of these things, putting them together in a way that worked harmoniously was a challenge.<br><br>
Before this project, I had never worked with Bootstrap. But after some trial and error, I got used to how containers worked and I was able to shape a website with a grid layout. Luckily, Bootstrap did a lot of the harder stuff for me, instead of leaving me to deal with media queries. All of the containers respond to smaller or larger screens, and I personally think the layout looks great on mobile. <br><br>
However, I understand I still have a lot to learn, and will be updating this site accordingly as I move forward.</p>
